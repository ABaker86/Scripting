# Scripting
Scripting for Automation

I am looking into application scripting in multiple languages so that I can work towards automation pipeline creation.
The `googleAppsScript` directory should contain a collection of test scripts I have put together quick-fast-and in a hurry for the purpose of testing theories and serves as a source of reference material should I need to look back on something that I have already made work once before.
